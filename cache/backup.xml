Your petty battles and countless wars have tortured and defiled this planet. We are here to take back what is rightfully ours and to bring it back to the days of which your kind has known not. Stand in the way of my father and you shall receive what your kind should have received long before. There is no hope so prepare yourself and witness his revelation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Godspeed!

Just don't mention this to the Kaiser or his kin or your death will be much more painful!"/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_398" txt="Delta V has been plagued with yet another catastrophe, one which threatens Exile and Legion alike. I have studied Kaiser Saeva Lionhart thoroughly since his arrival – his actions wreaked havoc amongst other worlds. This tyrannical maniac plans to exterminate all inhabitants of Delta V in order to bring purity and perfection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know that’s kinda what Baelius wants for this world, but killing everyone just seems like such a waste. So much cheap labor to exploit! Clearly Saeva is a terrible businessman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Defeating Saeva and his army directly would be nearly impossible…but there is a way. You will need the help of Delta V’s most powerful, both friend and foe alike. However you must battle them to prove your worth. First you must seek out &lt;b&gt;Selina near the Minetower&lt;/b&gt;. Return after you have defeated her in battle."/>

	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_399" txt="Honestly I didn’t think you were up to this, but now I see you have something more to prove. Selina is a great start, but we’re going to need more leverage on our side than one tough little girl. Seek out &lt;b&gt;Brachylagus in the Biological Preserve Archives&lt;/b&gt; and defeat him in battle. We will need the support of our long eared friends if we have any chance of continuing our efforts."/>

Well, doesn’t matter – we are going to need Hank on our side if we have any chance to get supplies for our war. &lt;b&gt;Hank&lt;/b&gt; is a stubborn man who’s grown tired of war, and he won’t join us so easily. You will have to &lt;b&gt;challenge and defeat him&lt;/b&gt; or else he will just think you are just another chump on the streets. Prove him wrong."/>

Well, she runs what’s left of the port. It’s not really all that prestigious to be the boss of a nuclear dump, but it makes her happy. Again, you’ll have to prove your worth through battle.

After all, he did organize the Exile rabble into a formidable fighting force to win the famous Infernal War. He’s the guy I need. Battle him in his office at the top of the &lt;b&gt;Minetower in the Wasteland&lt;/b&gt; and prove your virtue as a fearless warrior."/>

	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_405" txt="The Lawman is great, but his usefulness is tactics and strategy behind the front lines.

	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_406" txt="I’ve been putting off this request for awhile because I wanted to make sure you had a chance to succeed. If we are to have any hope to unify under one banner we are going to need the Exiles on our side, and the only way to do that is to &lt;b&gt;challenge and defeat the Exile leader in the Dread Plains&lt;/b&gt;. I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t think it was absolutely necessary. So get to it! Prove your worth! I believe in you…mostly."/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end406" txt="This is great! The Exile Leader along with all the Exile forces rally with us! They see the consequences we face if we fail… which is utter annihilation by the way. It’s hard not to see the benefits organizing under one unified banner brings! For your efforts I’ll give you the Sword of Alliance. You truly deserve it."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_407" txt="Alright, this is it! It all comes down to you. We’ve gotten everything else in order, and now we just need the Legion forces on our side.

It won’t be easy, but I think you can take him."/>

I just remembered – weeks ago an ammunition convoy from the Bazaar was intercepted by Marauders.

Lionhart’s ships are huge, but not nearly as big as the Dragonoid we blasted years back. I’ll need exact targeting coordinates for the ships or else the missed artillery rounds could devastate civilian populations. That’s NO GOOD! I’d wager if you &lt;b&gt;shake down some Lionhart Soldiers, you could get some coordinates&lt;/b&gt; I could use. If not…don’t worry about it. It’s just the annihilation of the entire planet. NO BIG DEAL!"/>

I can find a workaround, but I can’t do it if these probes are feeding him information on my every move.

He would prevent me from assisting you against Lionhart even if it meant the world falling into ruin!

The sheer size of this foul monster will make it difficult to defeat alone. You’ll need to convince someone equally crazy to aid you in this formidable fight.

Looks like ol' Captain Shogostick left a note:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was not a victory, but a test of your will. You all played your parts well.

Any opportunity to put down one of those mindless beasts we take, but in recent days the Guard has been out-numbered. Fear is spreading that the Queen has left us for dead.

This is only one of many examples, of different beasts inhabiting Delta V at the time."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_643" txt="Now, you will see the past as it was during Baelius’ arrival to Delta V. Baelius, an interstellar magnate, sought to expand his organization through mining valuable minerals, such as &lt;b&gt;tungsten, platinum, and gold.&lt;/b&gt; However, what he found was Varium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the Wasteland Mines, you will find each of the minerals mentioned above; collect them and we will continue. Unlike the miners – who risked their lives to mine it – you will merely need to collect it from deep within the mines. &lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end643" txt="Well done. Varium was more valuable than any other mineral you could find across the galaxy. With the help of a few investors, Project Delta began. The initial cost was steep, but the initial investment soon paid handsome dividends. Baelius’ profits skyrocketed within the first few years, creating the illusion of prosperity and opportunity for those seeking a better life. With that, the population of Delta V continued to expand, with people coming from across galaxies in search for fortune."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_644" txt="Baelius’ empire grew in power. With a bigger work force, he could mine more Varium, but he didn’t foresee one issue: transportation. It was not long until he discovered Tech Mages – with the help of machines, they could teleport themselves and other matter over short distances. These machines were powered by Varium. He applied this concept to his jump-ships, eliminating the need for overland shipping and the labour force required to run it. Unfortunately, it did cause a strain on the planet itself – overuse made the machines unstable, causing thousands of deaths and collapsing vast underground regions of Delta V. You can see what the Wastelands have become after years of recklessly mining Varium. &lt;b&gt;Face either of the Mine Guards, and they will share their stories with you, and how Wastelands came to be.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end644" txt="Indeed, the Wastelands were once as green and full of life as the Biological Preserve is now. Varium is the source of life for this planet, and taking it away is equivalent to pressing the self-destruct button. The effects of Baelius’ Varium mining will haunt this world for generations to come."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_645" txt="You may be thinking, “How did Tech Mages attain such a power to transport jump-ships through time and space?” QED – Quantum Energy Device. By amassing and exploiting the vast amounts of quantum energy (further empowered by Varium), they were able to bend time and space. The Elemental Controller did operate on a similar basis, which you have kindly ‘repaired’ for Alydriah Descarl, allowing you to enter and exit Void without suffering from any side effects – such as amnesia, hastened aging process, or reanimation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the Fortune City, there lies a sealed door guarded day and night. Atop the Energy Core is a crystal, emitting negative energy. Return it to me.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end645" txt="With a Void Crystal, you could theoretically construct a device which could open a portal to a different plane – be it the Afterlife, or a different dimension entirely. QED worked on the basis of warp travel, with one exception; even the slightest imbalance in the energy supplied would destabilize the Crystal, creating a wormhole which could potentially teleport you to an entirely different dimension, with no means to return. Baelius’ troops had to be very careful to prevent such incident from occurring; the consequences could be grave."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_646" txt="As time passed by, the original twelve organizations who invested into Baelius’ Project Delta saw his terrifying vision for the future, of Delta V – a zealot’s fanatical dream. They became uncomfortable and laid an ultimatum on the table: step down or be terminated forcibly. Baelius had a contingency for this: A small clause in the Project Delta contract requiring permanent residence on Delta V to maintain shareholder status. Unfortunately, it was too late for them to take their money and run. Instead, they were thrown into gulags, and tortured until all of their assets were depleted. Once done, they were “handled.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Put yourself in Baelius’ shoes and defeat a dozen of enemies in battle. In return, I will hand you over a copy of the original Blood Pact, signed by the investors.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end646" txt="With full control of Delta V, Baelius was able to start a brutal campaign to “cut spending.” The work force was divided in two – one half would be relegated to forced labour, the other would be trained as his Military, to enforce newly instituted slave labour. The years that followed were dark ones… but humanity can only stay oppressed for so long. The time had come for an uprising!"/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_647" txt="Baelius was a cunning man, and prepared himself for the uprising. Using experimental QED technology, Baelius intended to target all the insurgents and banish them into an unknown dimension between time and space, with no way of returning. However, the device targeted indiscriminately and removed 80% of the population instantly. Baelius gained absolute control of the planet, but lost many of his loyal followers and workforce. Thus, Delta V, once a place of hope and opportunity, became a place of desolation and ruin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Blood Pact.

	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_684" txt="Have you ever wondered where the Bio Hazards and Frysteland monstrosities came from? Their origins lie in the ruins of an old Legion research facility that dates back to before the Banishment.

	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_685" txt="Prior to being an android, I was Dr. Hannah Eleanor Grace, assigned to the medical staff of the Biological Research Lab under the direction of Alydriah. Many horrible creatures such as Bio Hazards and lizards with combustible saliva were contained there. There were many casualties, but Alydriah was determined to prove to Baelius that organics could be as effective in battle as androids. Before we dive too deep into my job description would you mind clearing the area of eavesdroppers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;We are in the middle of nowhere so I think no more than a handful of people to be around. Defeat three of them and the rest should get the message.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end685" txt="Good! The area should be clear so I can continue. My job was to make sure the scientists and guards remained in nominal condition for service. Those who weren’t were sent to help with the Delta Vault project. You might know them by their current name: the Infernal Androids."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_686" txt="The guards who were stationed at the lab were trained to notice creatures that weren’t developing along the path we intended for them and would either report these creatures to the scientists or attempt to put them down if they were deemed a threat. As more forces were drawn into the war, Alydriah replaced the human staff with automation. The robots proved more effective than the guards so much of the remaining staff was reassigned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Bio Guards in the Biological Preserve may have some information. You should interrogate them to find out. By interrogate, I mean beat into submission.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end686" txt="Any information? No. I should have guessed the current batch of guards are just the first thugs the Legion could find as people returned from the void. That is unfortunate, as few remain who recall the facility when it was in full operation."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_687" txt="The only other person in the Biological Preserve familiar with the Bio Hazards is Cinderella, but her ties to the Legion remain and I cannot risk bringing Alydriah’s wrath on our home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will require some upgrades from Ulysses so I can check samples from the Hazards myself. We can’t have any interruptions so you will need to cause a distraction to keep Legion surveillance busy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go and win five fights. That should cause enough of a distraction to keep the drones off our backs.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end687" txt="Now that I have the upgrade I require, we can get our Bio Hazard Samples."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_688" txt="We need to determine if the Bio Hazards in the Biological Preserve are the ones that were intended to be released from the lab or rogue mutants that managed to escape.

Edgar Boothe may think the Legion can make us a prosperous nation, but that path only holds darkness and death for us. &lt;b&gt;Information about the yetis will not be given freely, so prove your loyalty to the Krampus by helping to remove the Legion from our lands.

The beast’s power comes from the original, untainted yetis that were used to create it. The process appears to enhance a beast’s natural abilities. I am no scientists or shaman, but I know the process does not completely break their spirits or their minds. Behind their eyes remain sparks of intelligence. Alydriah sought to destroy that spark, but in that pursuit she failed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that I have helped you, I would like to ask a favor of you. &lt;b&gt;Can you go out and free a trapped baby yeti while I go and find something that may help you in your search for answers?&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end690" txt="Thank you for freeing those yetis, and as promised here is something that may help you. It is a sword we got from one of the Legion trackers and I am sure you will find some samples from the yetis on it."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_691" txt="The samples on the sword you brought back have yeti DNA, but also DNA common in many of the other beasts across Delta V. To produce conclusive results, I’ll need pure DNA from the afflicted yetis of Frysteland. I must determine if the monsters created by the Legion during their invasion of Frysteland suffer from the same genetic aberrations as the beasts created in Alydriah’s facility. &lt;b&gt;Defeating 5 Frysteland creatures should provide enough samples to produce useful results.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end691" txt="Say what you will about Alydriah, but she’s definitely consistent. I know Alydriah lead the invasion of Frysteland, and it seems she was responsible for the construction of the mutation facilities there as well. I would bet my synthetic right arm that all the beasts altered by Alydriah’s experiments possess unusual commonalities in their DNA, like a genetic fingerprint.  Again, I ask you hold onto this sample as it is much safer with you than it is with myself or Ulysses."/>

The records of the old facility are gone, but there must be more recent records of the Frysteland facility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can you find the notes Alydriah would have kept from her operations in Frysteland? &lt;b&gt;I am sure Alydroid, that robot of hers, is where the records are kept as they would be safe from almost anything. Bash it into submission and retrieve the notes.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end692" txt="These notes confirm my fears. Alydriah used what she learned at the Biological Research Lab to recreate it in Frysteland. Her intention appeared to be to use the Krampus as test subjects and food for the newly created beasts. Apparently, in rare cases, the mutation process was unable to warp the mind of the creature, leaving it sentient and very angry. One day we may see more monsters created by the Legion that do not obey their command. How many others are out there?"/>

Maybe Aldriah wasn’t just creating beasts in Frysteland to fight the Exiles, maybe she was creating them to defend herself from the monsters out there longing for a taste of her metallic blood.

	<field id="SQL_npc_chat_Monkakazi" txt="Alydriah, in her effort to turn the tide against the rebels, conducted numerous biological experiments on the indigenous creatures of Delta V. The monsters she created are known as BioBeasts. Countless humans suffered injury and death attempting to contain these unpredictable creatures. Alydriah quickly learned that humans are weak... and made of tasty meat!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We robotic Monkakazi were manufactured by her Legion scientists as a final layer of security to protect against experiments gone wrong.

While Snork had assisted the Krampus against Descarl during the Endless saga, he is ultimately a businessman, and a shady one at that. Unforeseen circumstances could drive him to ally with the Legion for revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, I don’t expect that Snork will pose a significant threat in the near future. It’s best to just continue monitoring him for now - the last thing we want is instability in an area as fragile and important as the Varium Mines. I hope that Alexis will remain content with his role; he’s one of my most competent and trusted comrades, but he can be overzealous at times. Perhaps I should redeploy him to the Dread Plains - we could use a man of his talents here."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_704" txt="Hail and well met, soldier. I hear that you’ve earned our leader’s confidence for this mission. That’s high praise, you know - he’s a very cautious man. Too cautious, perhaps, though I do understand his sentiments. &lt;b&gt;Clear the area of any potential spies by winning 10 PvP matches before I divulge our plans.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end704" txt="Impressive work! I can see why our leader recommended you. Now, I’ve been observing Snork for some time, and he’s definitely much more than a shady arms dealer. There’s something not quite right with him - even the boorish Shadow and Mine Guards sense it and veer well away from the man. Rumors say that his kind has been pursuing dangerous paths to vengeance... He may prove an unexpectedly formidable foe if he joins the Legion, and we have to do our utmost to prevent that. The only way to do that, of course, is to ensure that he embraces our cause instead. Go and convince Snork to join our glorious Uprising!"/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_705" txt="You wish me to join the Exile cause? Pffft! ...Pardon me, I have a slight cold...I meant to say that I am in fact rather interested in your offer.

Surely you didn’t think that I’d join your little band of rogues, did you? I have no regard for fools who harbor illusions of freedom or order. The truth of this world is clear for all who dare open their eyes - that institutions will fall, movements falter, principles discarded and peoples divided. The sole constant is everlasting war. Such is the decree of the gods themselves..."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_706" txt="Such nihilism! The poor soul must have been devastated by these long years of war. But it is precisely for such people that we must fight on - only through absolute victory can we bring peace for the living and the dead. It will be difficult to shake such cynicism through conventional means, however. We must understand his innermost thoughts and motivations before we can truly convince him. And the best way to do that is to face him in a contest of wills. &lt;b&gt;Best Snork in single combat and report your findings.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end706" txt="You say that he kept talking about a God of War? How curious - he did seem the superstitious sort, but I never realized how great his obsession was. Nonetheless, the existence of divine beings like Titan and the Endless means that his babblings may not be entirely delusional. We must conduct further investigations into this matter, despite their likely futility. Besides, even if this ‘god’ turns out to be a figment of Snork’s imagination, we may yet get him to warm to our cause. Pretend to be a potential devotee and seek out more information."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_707" txt="You’re interested in worshipping the God of War? Excellent! I can see the bloodlust in your eyes and your duel record - just what our god desires. I must say, however, that your sudden inquiry is rather suspicious, especially in light of your recent attempts to recruit me. You wouldn’t be thinking of taking advantage of my goodwill, would you? No matter - the God of War has his ways of dealing with false believers, kekeke! Now then, it’s time to start the initiation rites. &lt;b&gt;Slaughter 10 opponents in PvP as a sacrifice to our god.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end707" txt="Magnificent! You have proven yourself worthy of our cause. Let me now tell you about my history with the God of War. I am the last of the Sineal, native warriors of Frysteland and bitter nemeses of the Krampus. A hundred years ago, my ancestors embarked on a final showdown with the Krampus to claim their rightful ownership of the land. Our superior strength, skills and courage led us to the cusp of victory - but we were viciously denied by the summoned Endless. The war was lost in a single night, and we were evicted from our homeland. The natives of the regions beyond had no sympathy for us, and we were eventually forced into the desert, far from any civilization. Between the war with the Krampus, the natives’ persecution and the hostile wasteland environment, less than ten percent of the Sineal remained. It was a catastrophe approaching the level of genocide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Sineal were a proud people. Even when we were struggling for survival, we sought to regain our former glory. And so we turned to a power even greater than the god of our enemies - the God of War. Yet great sacrifice was required to summon him - bloodshed and conflict on a far grander scale than Delta V had ever seen. My ancestors thus passed their wisdom down generations in the hope that they may be avenged one day. As an acolyte, my duty is to conduct sacrificial rituals to please the God of War, and you shall assist me in this sacred task."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_708" txt="Snork’s tale is certainly disturbing, but I have difficulty believing it. The vast majority of Delta V’s natives were religious, but their gods did nothing to help them during Baelius’s reign of terror. Beings like the Endless must surely be the exception rather than the rule, and I fear that our dear friend is merely clinging to dying traditions in memory of his kind. While another divine ally would certainly sound the death knell for the Legion, it is foolhardy to dwell on such fantasies...wait, what’s that you have there?"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end708" txt="Impossible! This is a genuine divine artifact - you say Snork gave this to you? So his story was true after all...this is groundbreaking news. The stakes are now higher than any of us could have ever predicted. Snork’s allegiance could literally decide the fate of this war! We must recruit him at all costs - we cannot allow a divine superweapon to fall into the clutches of Alydriah Descarl! And just think what we can do with both the God of War and the Endless on our side! We could drive the Legion out of Frysteland and the Varium Mines...no, perhaps even all of Delta V! Soldier, our dreams of liberty are within reach! I must personally write to Snork to wed him to the cause!"/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_709" txt="Words alone won’t be enough to persuade a recluse like Snork. We need to show him that he cannot afford to maintain his passivity and that the war will inevitably come to him and force his hand. I am convinced that Descarl is preparing a massive attack on the Lawman’s tower to free Silas Auer and wrest control of the Varium Mines - it would be the perfect surprise attack after her diversions in Frysteland. The power that varium holds is immeasurable - whoever controls it controls Delta V. The Legion dogs in this area must know something. &lt;b&gt;Interrogate five Mine Guards, Shadow Guards or Heavy Mine Guards to retrieve proof of Descarl’s nefarious plans.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end709" txt="You couldn’t get anything out of them? Disappointing, but it’s to be expected. Even my patented torture techniques elicited only blabbers and tears. Descarl is too sly a fox to let mere mooks ruin her plans...it seems unlikely that we can uncover the truth in the near future. But we cannot simply wait - the sooner we can end this war, the better. Every day wasted means hundreds of lives lost. I only wish our leader better understood this...his incremental approach can be infuriating at times. We must capitalize on Legion defeats in the regional wars and strike while Descarl’s back is turned. &lt;b&gt;Give these forged papers to Snork to convince him of the coming Legion aggression.&lt;/b&gt; A white lie is a small price to pay for freedom."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_710" txt="You want to summon the God of War? Oh...um...wow, kids sure are enthusiastic nowadays. Look, as I said, he needs more bloodshed and conflict to awaken. Like, a lot more. I’d love to summon him too, but it’s not exactly the best time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, I admit it. That’s all a bunch of excuses. The God of War has already awoken, ever since the devastating Uprising a decade ago. He hasn’t gained enough energy to manifest on the mortal plane, but I can call upon his essence any time I wish. The reason I haven’t is because I’ve become used to these years of peace. You know, for most of my life, I thought that I was destined to inflict vengeance on the natives who cast us out, and retake Frysteland from the Krampus. I still do, but...the Banishment gave me time to think. Time to reflect on the horrors of war and consider whether I want to relieve that all over again, for the sake of ancestors I never knew. And I’m not sure I do, especially after my wife and child died...hey, you say you’ve got something for me?"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end710" txt="Pah! Exile propaganda! Still, the passion in these words...this is a man who is unshakeable in his beliefs, absurd as they are. It almost makes me feel ashamed of my inaction, my weakness...And it is true that people are returning from the Banishment, that the Legion-Exile conflict is intensifying...War will inevitably reach me again, and I cannot wallow in this false sense of security. It is time for me to make my stand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said, I am curious about the state of my native Frysteland. Much must have changed in the past century, especially with the ongoing Legion occupation. And the Krampus...how have they fared under Descarl’s iron heels? I heard that the Endless has allowed them to regain a degree of dignity - perhaps they will think kindly of me for helping them summon their god."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_711" txt="Hail, Outsider. What brings you to our little corner of the world?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh? You wish to inquire about the state of affairs in Frysteland? Well, I must say that the ongoing Legion occupation remains a thorn in the flesh, but the presence of the Endless has allowed us to regain some autonomy. Much of our territory and resources are still under Legion control, but we have enough for subsistence and a decent living. The protection of the Endless also deters Descarl’s brutes from abusing us or prying into our affairs. Morale is at an all-time high, and if the Legion is foolhardy enough to challenge us it shall surely face stiff opposition. This upturn in our fortunes could not have come about without those who helped us summon our god, and we are eternally grateful for their assistance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Say, what’s that mask you have there?"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end711" txt="This is...a Sineal relic?! You dare bring such filth before me, Outsider? This is high sacrilege, an insult to the Krampus and the throne!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What? One of the Sineal still lives, and told you to blaspheme before me? If the Sineal weren’t almost extinct, this would clearly be a declaration of war. To send a message of aggression despite his weakness...the Sineal truly are a barbaric race. I will never forget how my great-grandfather trembled in rage when he told us about our ancient enemies’ atrocities. How they ravaged our rightful territory. How they lusted after war. How they slaughtered even the innocent, massacring our women and children. His stories inspired the greatest revulsion in me, even as a child...It is only just that those savages were exterminated and expelled by the Endless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for your claims that this Snork helped us summon the Endless against Descarl...that was certainly no more than a cynical scheme to reignite our conflict with the Legion. Sowing the seeds of war under the guise of charity...what a despicable fiend! Tell him that I will not fall for his underhanded tricks, and will have his head if we ever meet!"/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_712" txt="So the Krampus King spits on my ancestors, sullies my honor and calls for my death. I did not expect gratitude, but I thought that some latitude was deserved...how laughably naive of me. I see now that the Krampus truly are the cold-hearted warmongers my ancestors warned me about. I was a fool for helping them against the Legion! Why, I should have let Descarl wipe them off the face of the earth! That Exile Commander was right - these years of stasis have rendered me a shell of my former self. A parody, even! Once upon a time, I had ambition, drive, a sense of purpose. It’s time I reclaimed all that. It’s time I fulfilled my destiny. It’s time - to summon the God of War!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’ll need specialized artifacts to conduct the summoning ritual. A Remnant of War from Central Station. Varium Ore from deep within the Infernal Mines. A Krampus Heart from battle with a Krampus Warrior. And last but not least, a gift from the God of War himself - a Demonic Spawn of one of his many minions, the Black Abyss Spider, earned through mortal combat. Go now while I prepare the last rites.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end712" txt="Can you feel it? This presence...this power...there’s no doubt. The God of War is coming! With him by my side, I shall crush the Krampus and retake my homeland. If only my ancestors could see me now!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...What’s this? I see a red glow yonder, it’s saying something to me...I see blood slicing through lands like gushing rivers, I see the sea and the sky ablaze, I see broken bodies and dying screams...this...this isn’t what I wanted. Where’s my triumph? Where’s my glory? Everything’s turning dark now...no...my lord, don’t consume me! I can bring you sacrifices, anything you please! Show mercy on your faithful servant...please...no…!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fwahahahaha! Snork is no more - I, the God of War, have now possessed him! He may have placated me through his sacrifices, but his decade-long inaction and attempt to use me spelt his doom. The world shall now know my wrath! Flee, mortal, and spread the word - the end of days has come!"/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_713" txt="What has Alexis done? How could he stray so far from my orders, without even informing me? The scale of the threat he has wrought is beyond all measure! Titan says that the God of War is an immortal creature of pure destruction that seeks power by spreading chaos and war. His might is almost inconceivable - even the most fearless of mortals go insane in his presence. There are already reports of civilians and militiamen killing indiscriminately near the Varium Mines - it seems that the deity’s influence is quickly destabilizing the region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Worse still, Alexis is not responding to our messages...I fear that he, too, may have become one of the God of War’s puppets. We cannot afford to have a madman tear us apart from within just when the conflict with the Legion is escalating. It pains me to say this, but there is only one way forward. &lt;b&gt;Eliminate Alexis to prevent the God of War from manipulating the Uprising.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end713" txt="It is done. Alexis, my dear friend, dead on my own orders. A harsh but necessary decision - I simply couldn’t risk repeating the tragedy at Baelius’ Citadel. Ten years ago, Caden betrayed us just as we were about to defeat Baelius himself, leaving the Exile in tatters and cursing Delta V to another decade of Legion rule. Alexis’s loyalty is indisputable, of course, but he may do in his madness what Caden did in his wickedness. This was the right choice for the Uprising, for freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...Still, I cannot help but indulge in regret. Surely there was something else I could have done? A way of breaking the deity’s control...or perhaps Alexis was able to resist the God of War in the first place. Was it truly necessity that forced my hand? Or was it cowardice and fear that led me to take the easy way out...?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enough of this. I of all people must stand strong. I cannot allow tragedy to cloud my mind. I cannot allow prejudice to hinder my cause. We have a crisis on our hands and we need to rise to the occasion. Soldier, it’s time to save the world."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_714" txt="The God of War may be formidable, but his incomplete manifestation means that he will remain defensive to consolidate his strength. We need to delay him long enough to prepare adequate countermeasures. This means that we must cut off his access to the single greatest source of energy on Delta V - Varium. The Mine and Shadow Guards, who have surely fallen under his spell, will definitely guide him to the Legion’s Varium reserves. We must stop them at all costs. &lt;b&gt;Defeat five Mine Guards, Heavy Mine Guards or Shadow Guards to slow down the God of War.&lt;/b&gt;"/>

We have no choice but to grit our teeth and ask the Legion for help. Go to Descarl and convince her to withdraw her troops from the Varium Mines. I have also contacted our allies from across Delta V, and I expect that they will request for your assistance soon."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_715" txt="The Exile Leader wants me to withdraw all my troops from the Varium Mines? Did I hear right?

There’s no way I’m going to accede to his ridiculous request.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to him, though, I now know that there’s a divine superweapon ripe for the picking. Just the thing we need to defeat the Krampus and their pesky god. I shall personally go to subjugate this God of War. It seems, however, that some duelists are causing a ruckus near the Varium Mines. Defeat 10 opponents in PvP to clear the way for me."/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end715" txt="Hmmm...it seems that these rabble-makers were driven mad by a supernatural presence.

Nothing the Legion can’t handle, of course, but the damage to our Varium assets will be considerable if we confront the deity here. Yet we could lose control of the Mines entirely if we don’t stop it soon...I hate to admit it, but a temporary alliance with the rebels is our best option.

That being said, I do have a trump card that can limit the God of War’s influence and trap him at the same time - a self-destruct device. &lt;b&gt;Activate the Big Red Button that I’ve placed in the Mines for such emergencies - it should be hidden near the old train terminal.&lt;/b&gt;"/>

We jaded old-timers liked to sneer at Alexis behind his back, but passionate youth like him is the only reason I still have faith in the Uprising.

	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_726" txt="I have found the perfect candidate - one who displays both strength in combat and weakness of mind. Shoggoth and his band of pirates are too weak to fight Kathool’s control, but still pose enough of a threat for the Imperial Navy to be concerned. All I have to do, then, is to override that slimy sea monster’s commands. &lt;b&gt;Beat Shoggoth until you obtain a White Flag. With this, I’ll soon have the Naval Yard in my grasp...&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end726" txt="Gah! It seems that Shoggoth’s mind is too weak - it would shatter if I try to wrest control from Kathool.

	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_727" txt="Of all the invaders that Delta V has seen over the decades, Saeva Lionhart interests me most. He claims to have an empire spanning multiple planets...no doubt he thinks himself above even a god like me. He is wrong, of course, so very wrong...and I shall prove it by freeing him from his bonds. &lt;b&gt;Defeat Saeva Lionhart twice in battle to snap him out of his temporal stasis and turn him into my ultimate puppet.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end727" txt="The barrier that restricts Saeva Lionhart would hardly phase me, but it does have some unexpected properties. It appears that Lionhart himself is unaware of his predicament, any more than the subject of a video is aware of a loop...this not only leaves him immune to damage and degradation, but also denies all possibility of physical and mental alterations. It is impossible for him to break the barrier of his own volition, and I will need advanced magic to free him. Unfortunately, I’m not in a position to do that now, but at my urging, Transcendence and Immanence will redouble their efforts to release their father. We may yet see a very interesting show in the Overlord Facility..."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_728" txt="This Zedmyr seems intent on creating an underworld empire. For peace, he says, but he’ll need to fight to secure that. That truly is the richest irony. In Delta V’s long and bloody history, hundreds of thousands have gone to war for precisely that - peace. How many of them gave up on their dreams? How many of them fell in battle? How many of them succeeded for a few years, before destroying everything with their own hands? Every one of them, without exception, failed in one way or another. Zedmyr will be no different. But as long as he is foolish enough to think otherwise, he will be easy to manipulate. &lt;b&gt;Defeat Zedmyr in battle so that I may probe his mind.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
	<field id="SQL_missions_txt_end728" txt="Like Nightwraith, Zedmyr is steadfast in his will. Unlike Nightwraith, his will happens to coincide with mine. He is too crafty and disciplined to act as quickly as I would like, but with my subliminal suggestions, he will surely act on his imperial ambitions when the time is right. While I cannot control him, I can push him to serve our common interests. The war between Legion and Exile may soon be the last thing on mortal minds..."/>
	<field id="SQL_mission_chat_729" txt="A nudge here, a poke there. A whisper in a willing ear. Slowly but surely, I have advanced my objectives - to spread conflict on Delta V, and to find a suitable vessel. Surprised at the latter goal? Well, you shouldn’t be. Did you perhaps forget that I grow stronger with conflict? You yourself have empowered me by engaging in battle with Delta V’s strongest mortals, to the point where I am again capable of possession.
